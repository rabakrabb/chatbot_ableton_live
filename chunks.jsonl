A clip’s Follow Action defines what happens to other clips in the same group after the clip plays. A group is defined by clips arranged in successive slots of the same track. Tracks can have an unlimited number of groups, separated by empty slots. You can also apply Follow Actions to scenes using controls in the Scene View. The Follow Action Controls. The Follow Action button activates or deactivates Follow Actions for the selected clip or scene. This button is disabled by default, and can be toggled using the Shift Enter keyboard shortcut. The Follow Action choosers allow selecting two different Follow Actions, A and B. The available Follow Actions are described in more detail below. The Chance A and Chance B controls set the probability (in a percentage) that each Follow Action will be triggered. If a clip or scene has Chance A set to 100% and Chance B set to 0%, Follow Action A will occur every time the clip or scene is launched. As we can see from this example, a Chance setting of 0% means that an action will never happen. Changing Chance B to 90% in this scenario makes Follow Action A occur much less often — approximately once out of every ten clip or scene launches. Note that in addition to the Chance A and Chance B controls, you can drag the slider located between them to adjust the Chance values. The Linked/Unlinked switch is only available for clips, and has two different modes. This switch is set to Linked by default. In Linked mode, the Follow Action is triggered at the end of the clip, or after the number of loops set in the Follow Action Multiplier field. In Unlinked mode, the Follow Action is triggered after the clip has played for the duration of the Follow Action Time. The Follow Action Time control, which is available for both clips and scenes, defines when the Follow Action takes place in bars-beats-sixteenths from the point in the clip or scene where play starts. The default for this setting is one bar. In the Sample/MIDI Notes Editor, a marker visualizes the Follow Action Time of a clip, and dragging this marker adjusts the clip’s Follow Action Time. There are ten Follow Actions available: means that no Follow Action will occur. Once a clip has been triggered with No Action, any other selected Follow Action in the clip will no longer have a chance of occurring, even if its Follow Action Chance is set to 100%. simply stops the clip after it has played for the chosen Follow Action Time.

To adjust target clip slot or scene value, drag the Jump Target slider up or down, or click and type in a number. Clips and scenes with assigned Follow Actions are indicated by a striped Clip/Scene Launch button, to help you identify them more easily. Assigning a Follow Action to a Clip Changes Its Clip Launch Button. Note that a clip Follow Action happens exactly after the duration that is specified by the Follow Action Time controls unless clip quantization is set to a value other than “None“ or “Global.“ Follow Actions circumvent global quantization but not clip quantization. Next to the Back to Arrangement button, an Enable Follow Actions Globally button lets you enable or disable all clip and scene Follow Actions in the Live Set. By disabling the Enable Follow Actions Globally button, you can edit running clips without being interrupted by playback jumping to other clips.

So why do you need Follow Actions? Music is repetition and change. Music based on loops or short melodic fragments has a tendency to sound static. Follow Actions allow you to create structures that will repeat but can also be surprising.

Cycles can be peppered with occasional rearrangements through the addition of other Follow Actions, such as “Any,“ with smaller relative Chance settings. You can also set up Follow Actions so that all selected clips play in a loop, by choosing the Create Follow Action Chain command from a clip’s context menu.

The clip uses a long sample, and Follow Time is set to one bar. Clicking on the clip will play the first bar, after which it will be very likely that it will play the first bar again. However, after a few repetitions, it will eventually come to Action B — “No Action“ — and continue playing the rest of the sample. Or, a clip can be played from its start to a specific point, when its Follow Action tells it to “Next.“ The same file can be used in the next clip in the group, but this one can be set to loop. This second clip can have any manner of Follow Action settings, so that it might then play forever, for a specified time or until random chance leads to the next clip in the group.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "16", "title": "7.3 Temporarily Looping Clips"}]}

You could, for example, use Follow Actions to randomly trigger clips with different MIDI controller clip envelopes, so that fine variations in pitch bend or modulation of an instrument or synth could occur as the clips in a group interacted. Audio clips could morph between different effect or clip transposition settings. Using Follow Actions and Legato Mode together provides a powerful way of gradually changing a melody or beat. Imagine that you have several identical clips of a melody that form a group, and they are set up to play in Legato Mode. Whenever their Follow Actions tell them to move on to another clip in the group, the melody will not change, as Legato Mode will sync the new play position with the old one in beat-time. The settings and clip envelopes of each clip (or even the actual notes contained in a MIDI clip) can then be slowly adjusted, so that the melody goes through a gradual metamorphosis.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "16", "title": "7.4 Adding Variations in Sync"}]}

Remember that each clip can have two different Follow Actions with corresponding Chance settings… have fun! The Instrument Has Been Isolated in a Dedicated Track. We might be bothered by the fact that muting the pad track (by turning off its Activator switch) also mutes the other MIDI track. To be precise, the other track keeps playing, but its MIDI is played by an instrument that is out of the mix. This can be easily remedied by cutting the clips from the pad track and pasting them into a third track that can be independently muted (and that can hold its own MIDI effects). The original pad track now acts as a mere instrument container. As we are not recording new clips into this track, we can set its Input Type chooser to “No Input,“ which makes its Arm button disappear and helps to avoid confusion when the mixer’s In/Out section is hidden.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "16", "title": "7.6 Creating Nonrepetitive Structures"}]}

Sometimes it is desirable to take an individual drum sound out of the mix for individual effects processing and mixing. This is possible because Impulse offers its sample slots as audio sources to other tracks. Using Impulse’s Individual Outs to Separately Process Sample Slots. We simply create an audio track and select from its Input Type chooser the track with the Impulse. The Input Channel chooser now offers, in addition to Pre FX, Post FX and Post Mixer, Impulse’s eight individual outputs, labeled according to the sample used in each slot. Notice that routing an individual output from Impulse into another track automatically takes this signal out of Impulse’s own internal mix. This convenience is not standard behavior of most plug-in instruments, however.

A multi-timbral instrument is like several instruments in one, with each component “part“ (or whatever term the manufacturer uses) receiving MIDI on a separate MIDI channel. Usually, the multi-timbral instrument offers individual outputs so that the parts can be separately routed into the mixer. Or, the instrument might offer a submixer of its own. Tracks Feeding MIDI to and Tapping Audio From the Parts of a Multi-Timbral Instrument. Sending MIDI from the mixer to a multi-timbral instrument is a variation of a case described above. One MIDI track hosts the multi-timbral instrument, and additional MIDI tracks are used to feed its individual parts. Each additional MIDI track has its Output Type chooser pointed to the track that contains the instrument, and its Output Channel chooser referencing the target MIDI channel. Additional audio tracks can then be used to tap the instrument’s individual outputs, as described earlier. It is also possible to use the External Instrument device to route MIDI to (and audio from) the secondary outputs on multi-timbral plug-ins. This scenario eliminates the need to create an additional audio track for each tapped output: Insert the multi-timbral instrument on a MIDI track. Insert an External Instrument device on another MIDI track. Select the track that contains the instrument in the first MIDI To chooser on the External Instrument device. Select the MIDI channel to route to in the second chooser on the External Instrument device. From the External Instrument’s Audio From chooser, select a secondary output on the instrument to which you are sending MIDI. Repeat steps 2-5 to feed and tap additional components of your multi-timbral instrument. You could also put the entire system of External Instrument devices into a single track, by placing each one in a Rack’s device chain. Note that the main outputs of the multi-timbral instrument will still output to the track that contains the instrument — only auxiliary outputs are available to the External Instrument device.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "17", "title": "5.2.6 Using Multi-Timbral Plug-In Instruments"}]}

The vocoder is inserted as an audio effect into the string track. It has a sidechain input for the speech signal, which has to be delivered from another track. So, we create an additional audio track named “Speech“ and set its Output Type chooser to the “Strings“ track. From the Output Channel chooser, we select the vocoder’s sidechain input. Some vocoder plug-ins include a built-in synthesizer to generate the “carrier“ signal. In this case, the only difference from the above procedure is that the vocoder instrument is dragged into a MIDI track. Feeding the sidechain audio input works as described above. A number of Live’s built-in devices have their own sidechain controls with integrated routing choosers that match those found in tracks.

Live’s crossfader works like a typical DJ-mixer crossfader, except that it allows crossfading not only two, but any number of tracks — including the returns. The Crossfader. The crossfader can be accessed via the Mixer Controls submenu in the View menu or the menu options in the mixer view control at the bottom right of Live’s window. Seven different crossfade curves are available so that you can choose the one that fits your style the best. To change the curve, right-click on the crossfader, then select an entry from the context menu. Choose from Seven Crossfader Curves. The chart below details the power level and response of each crossfader curve. Crossfader Curve Properties. The crossfader can be mapped to any continuous MIDI controller (absolute or incremental). In addition to the crossfader’s central slider, its absolute left and right positions are separately available for MIDI or keyboard mapping. There are two special scenarios for remote control with respect to the crossfader: A key mapped to any one of the three assignable crossfader positions (left, center or right) will toggle the crossfader’s absolute left and right positions. Mapping to two of the three fields allows for a “snapping back“ behavior when one of the assigned keys is held down and the other is pressed and released. Crossfade Assign Buttons. • • Each track has two Crossfade Assign buttons, A and B. The track can have three states with respect to the crossfader: If neither Assign button is on, the crossfader does not affect the track at all. If A is on, the track will be played unattenuated as long as the crossfader is in the left half of its value range. As the crossfader moves toward the right across the center position, the track fades out. At the crossfader’s rightmost position, the track is muted. Likewise, if B is on, the track’s volume will be affected only as the crossfader moves left across its center position. It is important to understand that the Crossfade Assign buttons do not affect the signal routing; the crossfader merely influences the signal volume at each track’s gain stage. The track can be routed to an individual output bus regardless of its crossfade assignment. In studio parlance, you can think of the crossfader as an on-the-fly VCA group. As with almost everything in Live, your crossfading maneuvers can be recorded into the Arrangement for later in-depth editing. To edit each track’s crossfade assignment, please choose “Mixer“ from the Envelope Device chooser and “X-Fade Assign“ from the Control chooser.

With this instrument, we have not attempted to emulate a specific vintage analog synthesizer but rather to combine different features of legendary vintage synthesizers into a modern instrument. Analog generates sound by simulating the different components of the synthesizer through physical modeling. This technology uses the laws of physics to reproduce how an object or system produces sound. In the case of Analog, mathematical equations describing how analog circuits function are solved in real time. Analog uses no sampling or wavetables; the sound is simply calculated in real time by the CPU according to the values of each parameter. This sound synthesis method ensures unmatched sound quality, realism, warmth and playing dynamics. 28. 1. 1 Architecture and Interface Analog’s signal flow is shown in the figure below: Diagram of Analog’s Signal Flow. The primary sound sources of the synthesizer are two oscillators and a noise generator. These sources can be independently routed to two different multi-mode filters, which are each connected to an amplifier. Furthermore, the signal flow can be run through the filters in series or in parallel. Analog also features two low-frequency oscillators (LFOs) which can modulate the oscillators, filters and amplifiers. Additionally, each filter and amplifier has its own envelope generator. The Analog interface consists of two parts: the display surrounded on all sides by the shell. The shell contains the most important controls for a given section while the display updates to show parameter visualizations and additional controls for the section selected in the shell. In addition to the synthesis modules, there is a Global section that contains general performance parameters such as instrument volume, vibrato and polyphony, as well as an MPE section that includes controls for three MPE sources: pressure, slide and per-note pitch bend, which make it possible to shape Analog’s sound using an MPE-enabled controller.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "1 Analog The Analog Instrument."}]}
{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "1.2 Oscillators", "level": "main", "content": "Display and Shell Parameters for the two Oscillators. Analog’s two oscillators use physical modelling to capture the character of vintage hardware oscillators. Because they use modelling instead of wavetables, they avoid aliasing. Each oscillator can be turned on or off independently via the switch labelled Osc 1 or Osc 2 in the shell, and the oscillator’s output level is adjusted by the slider to the right of this activator. The F1/F2 slider controls the balance of the oscillator’s output to each of the two filters. When the slider is at the center position, equal amounts of signal will be sent to both filters. When set all the way to the top or bottom, signal will only be sent to Filter 1 or Filter 2 respectively. The Shape chooser selects the oscillator’s waveform. The choices are sine, sawtooth, rectangular and white noise. When rectangular is selected, the Pulse Width parameter is enabled in the display, which allows you to change the pulse width of the waveform. Low Width values result in a very narrow waveform, which tends to sound tinny or “pinched.“ At 100%, the waveform is a perfect square, resulting in only odd harmonics. The pulse width can also be modulated by an LFO, via the slider next to Width. Note that this parameter is only enabled when the corresponding LFO is enabled. The Octave, Semi and Detune knobs in the shell function as coarse and fine tuners. Octave transposes the oscillator by octaves, while Semi transposes up or down in semitone increments. The Detune knob adjusts in increments of one cent (up to a maximum of three semitones (300 cents) up or down). Oscillator pitch can be modulated according to the settings of the Pitch Mod and Pitch Env parameters in the display. The LFO slider sets the amount that the LFO modulates pitch. Again, this parameter is only enabled if the LFO is on. The Key slider controls how much the oscillator tuning is adjusted by changes in MIDI note pitch. The default value of 100% means that the oscillator will conform to a conventional equal tempered scale. Higher or lower values change the amount of space between the notes on the keyboard. At 0%, the oscillator is not modulated by note pitch at all. To get a sense of how this works, try leaving one of the oscillators at 100% and setting the other’s Key scaling to something just slightly different. Then play scales near middle C. Since C3 will always trigger the same frequency regardless of the Key value, the oscillators will get farther out of tune with each other the farther away from C3 you play. The Pitch Env settings apply a ramp that modulates the oscillator’s pitch over time. Initial sets the starting pitch of the oscillator while Time adjusts how long it will take for the pitch to glide to its final value. You can adjust both parameters via the sliders or by adjusting the breakpoints in the envelope display. The Sub/Sync parameters in the display allow you to apply either a sub-oscillator or a hard synchronization mode. When the Mode chooser is set to Sub, the Level slider sets the output level of an additional oscillator, tuned an octave below the main oscillator. The sub-oscillator produces a square wave when the main oscillator’s Shape control is set to rectangle or sawtooth and a sine wave when the main oscillator is set to sine. Note that the sub-oscillator is disabled when the main oscillator’s Shape is set to white noise. When the Mode chooser is set to Sync, the oscillator’s waveform is restarted by an internal oscillator whose frequency is set by the Ratio slider. At 0%, the frequency of the internal oscillator and the audible oscillator match, so sync has no effect. As you increase the Ratio, the internal oscillator’s rate increases, which changes the harmonic content of the audible oscillator. For maximum analog nastiness, try mapping a modulation wheel or other MIDI controller to the Sync ratio.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "1.2 Oscillators"}]}

The chooser next to the filter activator selects the filter type from a selection of 2nd and 4th order low-pass, band-pass, notch, high-pass and formant filters. The resonance frequency of the filter is adjusted with the Freq knob in the shell, while the amount of resonance is adjusted with the Reso control. When a formant filter is chosen in the chooser, the Reso control cycles between vowel sounds. Below each mode chooser is an additional control which differs between the two filters. In Filter 1, the To F2 slider allows you to adjust the amount of Filter 1’s output that will be sent to Filter 2. The Follow switch below Filter 2’s mode chooser causes this filter’s cutoff frequency to follow the cutoff of Filter 1.

In addition to the envelope controls, the displays for the filters contain various modulation parameters and the Drive chooser. Cutoff frequency and resonance can be independently modulated by LFO, note pitch and filter envelope via the sliders in the Freq Mod and Res Mod sections respectively. Positive modulation values will increase the cutoff or resonance amounts, while negative values will lower them. The Drive chooser in the display selects the type of saturation applied to the filter output.

The Vib switch turns the vibrato effect on or off, while the percentage slider next to it adjusts the amplitude of the vibrato. Analog’s vibrato effect is essentially an additional LFO, but is hardwired to the pitch of both oscillators. The Rate slider sets the speed of the vibrato. Turning on the vibrato effect activates the four additional Vibrato parameters in the display. The Delay slider sets how long it will take for the vibrato to start after the note begins, while Attack sets how long it takes for the vibrato to reach full intensity. The Error slider adds a certain amount of random deviation to the Rate, Amount, Delay and Attack parameters for the vibrato applied to each polyphonic voice. The Amt < MW slider adjusts how much the modulation wheel will affect the vibrato intensity. This control is relative to the value set in the vibrato amount percentage slider in the shell. The Uni switch in the shell turns on the unison effect, which stacks multiple voices for each note played. The Detune slider next to this switch adjusts the amount of tuning variation applied to each stacked voice. Turning on the unison effect activates the two additional Unison parameters in the display. The Voices chooser selects between two or four stacked voices, while the Delay slider increases the lag time before each stacked voice is activated. The Gli switch turns the glide effect on or off. This is used to make the pitch slide between notes rather than changing immediately. With Legato enabled, the sliding will only occur if the second note is played before the first note is released. The Time slider sets the overall speed of the slide. Turning on the glide effect activates an additional Glide Mode chooser in the display. Selecting Const causes the glide time to be constant regardless of interval. Choosing Prop (proportional) causes the glide time to be proportional to the interval between the notes. Large intervals will glide slower than small intervals. The four Quick Routing buttons on the left side of the display provide an easy way to quickly set up common parameter routings. The upper left option configures a parallel routing structure, with each oscillator feeding its own filter and amplifier exclusively. The upper right button is similar, but the oscillators each split their output evenly between the two filters. The bottom left option feeds both oscillators into Filter 1 and Amp 1, bypassing Filter 2 and Amp 2 entirely. Finally, the bottom right option configures a serial routing structure, with both oscillators feeding Filter 1, which is then fed exclusively to Filter 2 and Amp 2. Note that the Quick Routing options do not affect any changes you may have made to the oscillator level, tuning or waveform parameters — they only adjust the routing of the oscillators to the filters and subsequent amplifiers. The Keyboard section in the display contains all of Analog’s tuning and polyphony parameters. The Octave, Semi and Detune controls function as coarse and fine tuners. Octave transposes the entire instrument by octaves, while Semi transposes up or down in semitone increments. The Detune slider adjusts tuning in increments of one cent (up to a maximum of 50 cents up or down). PB Range sets the range of pitch bend modulation in semitones. Stretch simulates a technique known as stretch tuning, which is a common tuning modification made to electric and acoustic pianos. At 0%, Analog will play in equal temperament, which means that two notes are an octave apart when the upper note’s fundamental pitch is exactly twice the lower note’s. Increasing the Stretch amount raises the pitch of upper notes while lowering the pitch of lower ones. The result is a more brilliant sound. Negative values simulate “negative“ stretch tuning; upper notes become flatter while lower notes become sharper. The Error slider increases the amount of random tuning error applied to each note. The Voices chooser sets the available polyphony, while Priority determines which notes will be cut off when the maximum polyphony is exceeded. When Priority is set to High, new notes that are higher than currently sustained notes will have priority, and notes will be cut off starting from the lowest pitch. Low is the opposite.

String simulates the sound produced by strings of different materials and sizes. Membrane is a model of a rectangular membrane (such as a drum head) with a variable size and construction. Plate simulates sound production by a rectangular plate (a flat surface) of different materials and sizes. Pipe simulates a cylindrical tube that is fully open at one end and has a variable opening at the other (adjusted with the Opening parameter.) Tube simulates a cylindrical tube that is closed at both ends. Selecting an object adds a visualization of it to the X-Y Controller display. Next to the Resonance Type drop-down is a Quality menu with options ranging from Eco to High. Quality controls the trade-off between the sound quality of the resonators and CPU performance by reducing the number of overtones that are calculated. Eco uses minimal CPU resources, while High creates more sophisticated resonances. Note that the Pipe or Tube resonators do not offer a Quality menu. Each resonator contains a copy button (1 → 2 in Resonator 1 and 2 → 1 in Resonator 2) that you can use to copy all the settings from one resonator to the other. Using the X-Y Controller, you can click and drag the mouse horizontally to change the resonant object’s decay time, or vertically to change the value of the Material/Radius parameter. The decay time adjusts the amount of the internal damping in the resonator and can also be adjusted using the Decay slider. • • • • • • • The Material slider adjusts the variation of damping at different frequencies. At lower values, low frequency components decay slower than high frequency components (which simulates objects made of wood, rubber, or nylon). At higher values, high frequency components decay slower (which simulates objects made of glass or metal). In the Pipe and Tube resonators, a Radius parameter is available in place of the Material parameter. This slider adjusts the radius of the pipe or tube. As the radius increases, the decay time and high frequency sustain both increase. At very large sizes, the fundamental pitch of the resonator also changes. The Decay and Material/Radius parameters can be modulated by note pitch and velocity via the Key and Vel sliders in the MIDI tab. An additional Ratio parameter is available for the Membrane and Plate resonators, which adjusts the ratio of the object’s size along its x and y axes. The Brightness control adjusts the amplitude of various frequency components. At higher values, higher frequencies are louder. This parameter is not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators. The Inharm knob adjusts the pitch of the resonator’s harmonics. At negative values, frequencies are compressed, increasing the number of lower partials. At positive values, frequencies are stretched, increasing the number of upper partials. Inharm can also be modulated by velocity via the slider in the MIDI tab. Note that this parameter is not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators. Opening, which is only available for the Pipe resonator, scales between an open and closed pipe. At 0%, the pipe is fully closed on one side, while at 100% the pipe is open at both ends. This parameter can also be modulated by velocity in the MIDI tab. The Hit slider adjusts the location on the resonator at which the object is struck or otherwise activated. At 0%, the object is hit at its center. Higher values move the activation point closer to the edge. The Hit position can also be randomized by increasing the value of the Rnd slider. Note that this parameter is not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators. Note Off determines the extent to which MIDI Note Off messages mute the resonance. At 0%, Note Offs are ignored, and the decay time is based only on the value of the Decay parameter. This is similar to how real-world mallet instruments behave, such as marimbas and glockenspiels. At 100%, the resonance is muted immediately at Note Off, regardless of the Decay time. The Pos. L and Pos. R sliders adjust the location on the left and right resonator where the vibrations are measured. At 0%, the resonance is monitored at the object’s center. Higher values move the listening point closer to the edge. These parameters are not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators, which are always measured in the middle of their permanently open end.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "2.4 Resonator Tabs"}]}

At negative values, the resonator will drop in pitch as you play higher on the keyboard. The Pitch Envelope parameters (Pitch Env and Time) apply a ramp that modulates the resonator’s pitch over time.

While Collision can produce extremely realistic simulations of conventional mallet instruments such as marimbas, vibraphones and glockenspiels, it is also very easy to “misuse“ the instrument’s parameters to produce sounds which could never be made by an acoustic instrument. To program realistic instrument simulations, it helps to think about the chain of events that produces a sound on a mallet instrument (a marimba, for example), and then visualize those events as sections within Collision: A beater (Mallet) strikes a tuned bar (Resonator 1). The tuned bar’s resonance is amplified by means of a resonating tube (Resonator 2). Thus the conventional model consists of the Mallet Exciter and the two resonators in a serial (1 > 2) configuration. Of course, to program unrealistic sounds, anything goes: Try using the Noise Exciter, particularly with long envelope times, to create washy, quasi-granular textures. These parameters can also be used to simulate special acoustic effects such as bowed vibraphones or crystal glasses. Experiment with the resonators in parallel (1 + 2) configuration. Use the LFOs and MIDI controllers (including MPE-enabled ones) to modulate Collision’s parameters. A word of caution: in many ways, Collision’s models are idealized versions of real-world objects. Consequently, it is very easy to program resonances that are much more sensitive to input than any physical resonator could be.

Unison slightly detunes the four voices for each note independently from one another. The Unison Strength slider determines how much pitch variation is applied across individual voices. When set to higher values, more variation is added to each voice. You can select the maximum number of voices that can play simultaneously using the Voices drop-down menu.

The Sub Oscillator Amount knob sets the oscillator’s level. The oscillator envelope uses the device’s attack and decay settings. The Sub Oscillator Frequency sets the oscillator’s frequency, from 30 to 1 20 Hz. Noise Osc layers a noise oscillator with the sample. The Noise Amount knob sets the oscillator’s level. The oscillator envelope uses the device’s attack and decay settings. The Noise Color control sets the frequency used to filter the oscillator. Note that time-based and frequency-related controls in the Stretch, Loop, FM, Ring Mod, Sub Osc, and Noise Osc effects are influenced by the device’s global pitch controls and the MIDI note played. This ensures that each effect’s pitch follows the pitch of the sample as different notes are played or when the sample is transposed. Additionally, the modulation decay of the FM and Ring Mod effects is affected by the global decay time.

The tine bar is where the hammer hits the fork while the tone bar is a tuned metal resonator, sized appropriately to produce the correct pitch. Once the fork is activated, it will continue to resonate on its own for a long time. But releasing the key applies a damper to the fork, which mutes it more quickly.

At 0%, Electric will play in equal temperament, which means that two notes are an octave apart when the upper note’s fundamental pitch is exactly twice the lower note’s. But because the actual resonance behavior of a vibrating tine or string differs from the theoretical model, equal temperament tends to sound “wrong“ on pianos. Stretch tuning attempts to correct this by sharpening the pitch of upper notes while flattening the pitch of lower ones. The result is a more brilliant sound. Negative values simulate “negative“ stretch tuning; upper notes become flatter while lower notes become sharper.

The top chooser selects either a physical MIDI port, or a multitimbral plug-in. If you select a MIDI port (for use with an external synthesizer), the second chooser’s options will be MIDI channel numbers. If another track in your Set contains a multitimbral plug-in, you can select this track in the top chooser. In this case, the second chooser allows you to select a specific MIDI channel in the plug-in. The Audio From chooser provides options for returning the audio from the hardware synth or plug-in device. If you’re routing to a hardware synth, use this chooser to select the ports on your audio interface that are connected to the output of your synth. The available choices you’ll have will depend on the settings in the Audio Settings. If you’re routing to a multitimbral plug-in on another track in your Live Set, the Audio From chooser will list the auxiliary outputs in the plug-in. Note that the main outputs will be heard on the track that contains the instrument. The Gain knob adjusts the audio level coming back from the sound source. This level should be set carefully to avoid clipping. Since external devices can introduce latency that Live cannot automatically detect, you can manually compensate for any delays by adjusting the Hardware Latency slider. The button next to this slider allows you to set your latency compensation amount in either milliseconds or samples. If your external device connects to Live via a digital connection, you will want to adjust your latency settings in samples, which ensures that the number of samples you specify will be retained even when changing the sample rate. If your external device connects to Live via an analog connection, you will want to adjust your latency settings in milliseconds, which ensures that the amount of time you specify will be retained when changing the sample rate. Note that adjusting in samples gives you finer control, so even in cases when you’re working with analog devices, you may want to “fine tune“ your latency in samples in order to achieve the lowest possible latency. In this case, be sure to switch back to milliseconds before changing your sample rate. Any latency introduced by devices within Live will be compensated for automatically, so the slider will be disabled when using the External Instrument Device to route internally.

When deactivated, an oscillator will play a constant pitch of C3 for all incoming MIDI notes, or the root of a scale in the C3 octave if Scale Mode has been activated. This is useful for performing drones or percussive sounds, for example. Enabling the Phase Reset switch resets the phase of the oscillator to a consistent value with each new note. The Phase Spread switch also becomes accessible when Phase Reset is enabled. When Phase Spread is activated, the oscillator’s start phase is spread based on the Spread modulation source in the Modulation Matrix. When Phase Spread is deactivated, the start phase is set to zero. Two switches can be activated in the Scale Awareness section: Oscillator Scale Awareness and Filter Scale Awareness.

Meld’s two engines each have a dedicated filter, A and B, which can be turned on or off independently via switches in the Filters section. The Filter Frequency knob sets the center of the filter’s cutoff frequency. The Filter Type drop-down menu lets you choose from seventeen different filter types. Each filter has two macro knobs, which change with the filter type selected. The most common filter macro knobs in Meld are Q and Drive. Q adjusts the emphasis of the frequencies around a filter’s cutoff frequency. Drive applies saturation to the input signal before it passes through the filter, which is useful for producing distortion. The SVF 1 2dB and 24dB filters are state variable filters. The L-B-H-N macro control morphs through this filter type’s four possible configurations: low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, and notch. The MS2 filters are modeled on a Sallen-Key design from a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth, which applies soft clipping to limit resonance. They are available in low-pass and high-pass configurations in Meld. The OSR filter is modeled on a state variable filter from a rare British monosynth whose resonance is limited by a unique hard-clipping diode. It is available in a band-pass configuration in Meld. LP Crunch 1 2dB is a dual-mode low-pass filter that feeds the distortion it produces back into itself. The LP Switched Res filter is modeled on low-pass filters whose resistors are replaced with fast switches to produce downsampling artifacts. The Lofi macro knob changes the frequency of the filter’s resistors. If set to a high value, the filter produces a more crushed sound. If set to a low value, it produces a smoother sound. Filther is modeled on a low-pass filter that applies distortion to a signal’s input and output. It uses a hard diode clipper on the input signal and soft saturation on the output signal. The Eq Peak and Eq Notch filters are peak and notch filters that apply gain and width to an input signal. The Eq Peak filter’s Boost macro knob boosts frequencies around the filter’s cutoff point. The Eq Notch filter’s Cut macro knob cuts frequencies around the filter’s cutoff point. The Phaser filter is a six-stage delayless inverted feedback phaser with variable feedback and notch spacing. The Phaser filter’s Feedback macro knob sets the amount of output being fed back into the filter’s input. The Spread macro knob adjusts the spacing between the filter’s notches in the frequency spectrum. The Redux filter is a resampler and bitcrusher with a variable sample rate, quantization, and knob over the amount of resampling artifacts it produces. The Crush macro knob sets the bit depth of the filter’s output. The Lofi macro knob adjusts the mix between a filtered, sample rate-reduced version of the signal and the unfiltered, downsampled artifacts Redux has produced. The Vowel filter is a formant filter that mimics the characteristics of vowels being pronounced, with various configurations that can be morphed through using the filter’s Morph macro knob. The Comb + and Comb - filters are feedforward and feedback filters. The Feedback macro knob adjusts the amount of feedforward or feedback being sent from the filter’s delayed output back into its input. The Damp knob applies a low-pass filter to the filter’s output, to damp high frequencies. The Plate Resonator filter applies a set of modal resonators tuned to the first 32 modes of a rectangular plate to the input signal. The plate’s size, resonance, and dimension ratio can be modified using its macro knobs. When Filter Scale Awareness is enabled, this filter’s resonating frequencies will be in scale. The Membrane Resonator filter applies a set of modal resonators tuned to the first 32 modes of a circular membrane to the input signal. The membrane’s size, resonance, and high frequency damping can be modified using its macro knobs.

When your mouse is over the Oscillator display area, the cursor will change to a pencil. Drawing in the display area then raises or lowers the amplitudes of the harmonics. As you adjust the amplitudes, the Status Bar will show the number of the harmonic you’re adjusting as well as its amplitude. Holding Shift and dragging will constrain horizontal mouse movement, allowing you to adjust the amplitude of only one harmonic at a time. You can switch between editing the first 16, 32 or 64 harmonics via the switches to the right of the display. Higher harmonics can be generated by repeating the drawn partials with a gradual fadeout, based on the settings in the Repeat chooser. Low Repeat values result in a brighter sound, while higher values result in more high-end roll-off and a more prominent fundamental. With Repeat off, partials above the 16th, 32nd or 64th harmonic are truncated. The context menu in the harmonics display offers options for editing only the even or odd harmonics.

{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "9.2.3 More Oscillator Parameters", "level": "main", "content": "The frequency of an oscillator can be adjusted in the shell with its Coarse and Fine controls. An oscillator’s frequency usually follows that of played notes, but for some sounds it might be useful to set one or more oscillators to fixed frequencies. This can be done for each individual oscillator by activating the Fixed option. This allows the creation of sounds in which only the timbre will vary when different notes are played, but the tuning will stay the same. Fixed Mode would be useful, for example, in creating live drum sounds. Fixed Mode also allows producing very low frequencies down to 0. 1 Hz. Note that when Fixed Mode is active, the frequency of the oscillator is controlled in the shell with the Frequency (Freq) and Multiplier (Multi) controls. Operator includes a special Osc < Vel control for each oscillator that allows altering frequency as a function of velocity. This feature can be very useful when working with sequenced sounds in which the velocity of each note can be adjusted carefully. Part of this functionality is the adjacent Q (Quantize) button. If this control is activated, the frequency will only move in whole numbers, just as if the Coarse control were being manually adjusted. If quantize is not activated, the frequency will be shifted in an unquantized manner, leading to detuned or inharmonic sounds (which very well could be exactly what you want…). The amplitude of an oscillator depends on the Level setting of the oscillator in the shell and on its envelope, which is shown and edited when the Envelope display is visible. The envelopes can also be modified by note velocity and note pitch with the Vel and Key parameters available in the Envelope section of each oscillator’s display. The phase of each oscillator can be adjusted using the Phase control in its display. With the R (Retrigger) button enabled, the waveform restarts at the same position in its phase each time a note is triggered. With R disabled, the oscillator is free-running. As explained earlier oscillators can modulate each other when set up to do so with the global display’s algorithms.

{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "9.2.4 Aliasing", "level": "main", "content": "Aliasing distortion is a common side effect of all digital synthesis and is the result of the finite sample rate and precision of digital systems. It mostly occurs at high frequencies. FM synthesis is especially likely to produce this kind of effect, since one can easily create sounds with lots of high harmonics. This also means that more complex oscillator waveforms, such as “Saw 32,“ tend to be more sensitive to aliasing than pure sine waves. Aliasing is a two-fold beast: A bit of it can be exactly what is needed to create a cool sound, yet a bit too much can make the timbre unplayable, as the perception of pitch is lost when high notes suddenly fold back into arbitrary pitches. Operator minimizes aliasing by working in a high-quality Antialias mode. This is on by default for new patches, but can be turned off in the global section. The Tone parameter in the global section also allows for controlling aliasing. Its effect is sometimes similar to a low-pass filter, but this depends on the nature of the sound itself and cannot generally be predicted. If you want to familiarize yourself with the sound of aliasing, turn Tone up fully and play a few very high notes. You will most likely notice that some notes sound completely different from other notes.

It runs at audio rates, and it modulates the frequency of the other oscillators. It is possible to switch LFO modulation on or off for each individual oscillator (and the filter) using the Dest. A buttons in the LFO’s display. The intensity of the LFO’s modulation of these targets can be adjusted by the Dest. A slider. The LFO can also be turned off entirely if it is unused. The Dest. B chooser allows the LFO to modulate an additional parameter. The intensity of this modulation is determined by the Dest. B slider. The LFO offers a choice of classic LFO waveforms, sample and hold (S&H), and noise. Sample and hold uses random numbers chosen at the rate of the LFO, creating the random steps useful for typical retro-futuristic sci-fi sounds. The noise waveform is simply band-pass filtered noise. Tip: FM synthesis can be used to create fantastic percussion sounds, and using the LFO with the noise waveform is the key to great hi-hats and snares. The frequency of the LFO is determined by the LFO Rate control in the shell, as well as the low/high/ sync setting of the adjacent LFO Range chooser. The frequency of the LFO can follow note pitch, be fixed or be set to something in between. This is defined by the Rate < Key parameter in the LFO’s display. With the R (Retrigger) button enabled, the LFO restarts at the same position in its phase each time a note is triggered. With R disabled, the LFO is free-running. The overall intensity of the LFO is set by the LFO Amount control in the shell. This parameter scales both the Dest. A and B amounts and can be modulated by note velocity via the display’s Amt < Vel control.

{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "9.4 Envelopes", "level": "main", "content": "Operator’s Oscillator B Envelope. Operator has seven envelopes: one for each oscillator, a filter envelope, a pitch envelope and an envelope for the LFO. All envelopes feature some special looping modes. Additionally, the filter and pitch envelopes have adjustable slopes. Each oscillator’s volume envelope is defined by six parameters: three rates and three levels. A rate is the time it takes to go from one level to the next. For instance, a typical pad sound starts with the initial level “-inf dB“ (which is silence), moves with an attack rate to its peak level, moves from there to the sustain level with a decay rate, and then finally, after Note Off occurs, back to “-inf dB“ at the release rate. Operator’s display provides a good overview of the actual shape of any particular envelope and lets you directly adjust the curve by clicking on a breakpoint and dragging. The breakpoints retain their selection after clicking, allowing them to be adjusted with the keyboard’s cursor keys, if desired. Envelope shapes can be copied and pasted from one oscillator to another in Operator using the Envelope Display’s context menu. As mentioned above, the filter and pitch envelopes also have adjustable slopes. Clicking on the diamonds between the breakpoints allows you to adjust the slope of the envelope segments. Positive slope values cause the envelope to move quickly at the beginning, then slower. Negative slope values cause the envelope to remain flat for longer, then move faster at the end. A slope of zero is linear; the envelope will move at the same rate throughout the segment. With FM synthesis, it is possible to create spectacular, endless, permuting sounds; the key to doing this is looping envelopes. Loop Mode can be activated in the lower left corner of the display. If an envelope in Operator is in Loop Mode and reaches sustain level while the note is still being held, it will be retriggered. The rate for this movement is defined by the Loop Time parameter. Note that envelopes in Loop Mode can loop very quickly and can therefore be used to achieve effects that one would not normally expect from an envelope generator. While Loop Mode is good for textures and experimental sounds, Operator also includes Beat and Sync Modes, which provide a simple way of creating rhythmical sounds. If set to Beat Mode, an envelope will restart after the beat time selected from the Repeat chooser. In Beat Mode, the repeat time is defined in fractions of song time, but notes are not quantized. If you play a note a bit out of sync, it will repeat perfectly but stay out of sync. In Sync Mode however, the first repetition is quantized to the nearest 16th note and, as a result, all following repetitions are synced to the song tempo. Note that Sync Mode only works if the song is playing, and otherwise it will behave like Beat Mode. To avoid the audible clicks caused by restarting from its initial level, a looped envelope will restart from its actual level and move with the set attack rate to peak level. There is also a mode called Trigger that is ideal for working with percussive sounds. In this mode, Note Off is ignored. This means that the length of time a key is held has no effect on the length of the sound. The rates of all the envelopes in Operator can be scaled in unison by the Time control in the global section of the shell. Note that beat-time values in Beat and Sync Modes are not influenced by the global Time parameter. Envelope rates can be further modified by note pitch, as dictated by the Time < Key parameter in the global section’s display. The rate of an individual envelope can also be modified by velocity using the Time < Vel parameter. These modulations in conjunction with the loop feature can be used to create very, very complex things… The pitch envelope can be turned on or off for each individual oscillator and for the LFO using the Destination A-D and LFO buttons in its display. The intensity of this envelope’s modulation of these targets can be adjusted by the Dest. A slider and the envelope can be turned off altogether via the switch in the pitch section of the shell. Like the LFO, the pitch envelope can modulate an additional parameter as chosen by the Dest. B chooser. The intensity of this modulation is determined by the Amt. B slider and the main Pitch Env value. The pitch and filter envelopes each have an additional parameter called End, which determines the level the envelope will move to after the key is released. The rate of this envelope segment is determined by the release time. Tip: If the pitch envelope is only applied to the LFO and is looping, it can serve as another LFO, modulating the rate of the first. And, since the envelope of the LFO itself can loop, it can serve as a third LFO modulating the intensity of the first!", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "9.4 Envelopes"}]}

Operator’s filters can be very useful for modifying the sonically rich timbres created by the oscillators. And, since the oscillators also provide you with the classic waveforms of analog synthesizers, you can very easily build a subtractive synthesizer with them. Operator offers a variety of filter types including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and a special Morph filter. Each filter can be switched between 1 2 and 24 dB slopes as well as a selection of analog-modeled circuit behaviors developed in conjunction with Cytomic that emulate hardware filters found on some classic analog synthesizers. The Clean circuit option is a high-quality, CPU-efficient design that is the same as the filters used in EQ Eight. This is available for all of the filter types. The OSR circuit option is a state-variable type with resonance limited by a unique hard-clipping diode. This is modeled on the filters used in a somewhat rare British monosynth, and is available for all filter types. The MS2 circuit option uses a Sallen-Key design and soft clipping to limit resonance. It is modeled on the filters used in a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters. The SMP circuit is a custom design not based on any particular hardware. It shares characteristics of both the MS2 and PRD circuits and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters. The PRD circuit uses a ladder design and has no explicit resonance limiting. It is modeled on the filters used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters. The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance. Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts frequencies near that point. When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the filter. The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass. You can quickly snap the Morph control to a low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, or notch setting via dedicated options in the context menu of the Morph slider. The Envelope and Filter buttons in the filter section’s display area toggle between showing the filter envelope and its frequency response. Filter cutoff frequency and resonance can be adjusted in the shell or by dragging the filter response curve in the display area. Filter frequency can also be modulated by the following: Note velocity, via the Freq < Vel control in the filter’s display. Note pitch, via the Freq < Key control in the filter’s display. Filter envelope, via the Envelope control in the filter’s display. LFO, done either by enabling the Dest. A “FIL“ switch in the LFO’s display, or by setting Dest. B to Filter Freq. The context menu for the Frequency knob contains an entry called “Play by Key.“ This automatically configures the filter for optimal key tracking by setting Freq < Key to 100% and setting the cutoff to 466 Hz. The filter’s signal can be routed through a waveshaper, whose curve type can be selected via the Shaper chooser. The Shaper Drive (Shp. Drive) slider boosts or attenuates the signal level being sent to the waveshaper, while the overall balance between the dry and processed signals can be adjusted with the Dry/Wet control.

To achieve special effects, you could, for instance, create a sequence where Spread is 0 most of the time and turned on only for some notes. These notes will then play in stereo, while the others will play mono. Note that Spread is a CPU-intensive parameter.

Remember that you can also access explanations of controls in Live (including those belonging to Operator) directly from the software by placing the mouse over the control and reading the text that appears in the Info View. Parameters in this list are grouped into sections based on where they appear in Operator. 28.9.10. 1 Global Shell and Display Time — This is a global control for all envelope rates. Tone — Operator is capable of producing timbres with very high frequencies, which can sometimes lead to aliasing artifacts. The Tone setting controls the high frequency content of sounds. Higher settings are typically brighter but also more likely to produce aliasing. Volume — This sets the overall volume of the instrument. Algorithm — An oscillator can modulate other oscillators, be modulated by other oscillators, or both. The algorithm defines the connections between the oscillators and therefore has a significant impact on the sound that is created. Voices — This sets the maximum number of notes that can sound simultaneously. If more notes than available voices are requested, the oldest notes will be cut off. Retrigger (R) — When enabled, notes that are enabled will be retriggered, rather than generating an additional voice. Interpolation — This toggles the interpolation algorithm of the oscillators and the LFO. If turned off, some timbres will sound more rough, especially the noise waveform. Turning this off will also save some CPU power. Antialias — This toggles Operator’s high-quality antialias mode, which helps to minimize high-frequency distortion. Disabling this modes reduces the CPU load. Time < Key — The rates of all envelopes can be controlled by note pitch. If the global Time < Key parameter is set to higher values, the envelopes run faster when higher notes are played. Pitch Bend Range (PB Range) — This defines the effect of MIDI pitch bend messages. Pan — Use this to adjust the panorama of each note. This is especially useful when modulated with clip envelopes. Pan < Key (Key) — If Pan < Key is set to higher values, low notes will pan relatively more to the left channel, and higher notes to the right. Typically this is used for piano-like sounds. Pan < Random (Rnd) — This defines the extent to which notes are randomly distributed between the left and right channels.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "9.10 The Complete Parameter List"}]}

Sample and Hold (S&H) creates random steps, and Noise supplies band-pass filtered noise. All waveforms are band-limited to avoid unwanted clicks. LFO Range — The LFO covers an extreme frequency range. Choose Low for a range from 50 seconds to 30 Hz, or Hi for 8 Hz to 1 2 kHz. Sync causes the LFO’s rate to be synced to your Set’s tempo. Due to the possible high frequencies, the LFO can also function as a fifth oscillator. Retrigger (R) — When enabled, the LFO restarts at the same position in its phase each time a note is triggered.

Osc Coarse Frequency (Coarse) — The relationship between oscillator frequency and note pitch is defined by the Coarse and Fine parameters. Coarse sets the ratio in whole numbers, creating a harmonic relationship. Osc Fine Frequency (Fine) — The relationship between oscillator frequency and note pitch is defined by the Coarse and Fine parameters. Fine sets the ratio in fractions of whole numbers, creating an inharmonic relationship. Osc Fixed Frequency On (Fixed) — In Fixed Mode, oscillators do not respond to note pitch but instead play a fixed frequency. Osc Fixed Frequency (Freq) — This is the frequency of the oscillator in Hertz. This frequency is constant, regardless of note pitch. Osc Fixed Multiplier (Multi) — This is used to adjust the range of the fixed frequency. Multiply this value with the value of the oscillator’s Freq knob to get actual frequency in Hz. Osc Output Level (Level) — This sets the output level of the oscillator. If this oscillator is modulating another, its level has significant influence on the resulting timbre. Higher levels usually create bright and/or noisy sounds. Envelope / Oscillator Switches — These switches toggle the display between the oscillator’s envelope and its harmonics editor. 16/32/64 — These switches set the number of partials that are available for user editing. Osc Waveform (Wave) — Choose from a collection of carefully selected waveforms. You can then edit them via the harmonics editor. Osc Feedback (Feedback) — An oscillator can modulate itself if it is not modulated by another oscillator. The modulation is dependent not only on the setting of the feedback control but also on the oscillator level and the envelope. Higher feedback creates a more complex resulting waveform. Osc Phase (Phase) — This sets the initial phase of the oscillator. The range represents one whole cycle. Retrigger (R) — When enabled, the oscillator restarts at the same position in its phase each time a note is triggered. With R disabled, the oscillator is free-running. Repeat — Higher harmonics can be generated by repeating the drawn partials with a gradual fadeout, based on the settings in the Repeat chooser. Low Repeat values result in a brighter sound, while higher values result in more high-end roll-off and a more prominent fundamental. With Repeat off, partials above the 16th, 32nd or 64th harmonic are truncated. Osc Frequency < Velocity (Osc < Vel) — The frequency of an oscillator can be modulated by note velocity. Positive values raise the oscillator’s pitch with greater velocities, and negative values lower it. Osc Freq < Vel Quantized (Q) — This allows quantizing the effect of the Frequency < Velocity parameter. If activated, the sonic result is the same as manually changing the Coarse parameter for each note. Volume Envelope Rates < Velocity (Time < Vel) — This parameter exists for filter, pitch, LFO and volume envelopes. It is therefore listed in the section on envelopes. Osc Output Level < Velocity (Vel) — This defines how much the oscillator’s level depends upon note velocity. Applying this to modulating oscillators creates velocity-dependent timbres.

For the oscillator envelopes, the shape of this segment of the envelope is exponential. For the filter and pitch envelopes, the shape of the segment can be adjusted. Envelope Release Time (Release) — This is the time it takes for a note to reach the end level after a Note Off message is received. For the oscillator envelopes, this level is always -inf dB and the shape of the segment is exponential. For the filter and pitch envelopes, the end level is determined by the End Level parameter and the shape of the segment can be adjusted. This envelope segment will begin at the value of the envelope at the moment the Note Off message occurs, regardless of which segment is currently active. Envelope Initial Level (Initial) — This sets the initial value of the envelope. Envelope Peak Level (Peak) — This is the peak level at the end of the note attack. Envelope Sustain Level (Sustain) — This is the sustain level at the end of the note decay. The envelope will stay at this level until note release unless it is in Loop, Sync or Beat Mode. Envelope End Level (End) — (LFO, Filter and pitch envelopes only) This is the level reached at the end of the Release stage. Envelope Loop Mode (Loop) — If this is set to Loop, the envelope will start again after the end of the decay segment. If set to Beat or Sync, it will start again after a given beat-time. In Sync Mode, this behavior will be quantized to song time. In Trigger mode, the envelope ignores Note Off. Envelope Beat/Sync Rate (Repeat) — The envelope will be retriggered after this amount of beat-time, as long as it is still on. When retriggered, the envelope will move at the given attack rate from the current level to the peak level. Envelope Loop Time (Time) — If a note is still on after the end of the decay/sustain segment, the envelope will start again from its initial value. The time it takes to move from the sustain level to the initial value is defined by this parameter. Envelope Rates < Velocity (Time < Vel) — Envelope segments will be modulated by note velocity as defined by this setting. This is especially interesting if the envelopes are looping. Note that this modulation does not influence the beat-time in Beat or Sync Modes, but the envelope segments themselves. The filter and pitch envelopes also provide parameters that adjust the slope of their envelope segments. Positive slope values cause the envelope to move quickly at the beginning, then slower. Negative slope values cause the envelope to remain flat for longer, then move faster at the end. A slope of zero is linear; the envelope will move at the same rate throughout the segment.

It has been designed from the start to handle multi-gigabyte instrument libraries with ease, and it imports most common library formats. But with Sampler, playback is only the beginning; its extensive internal modulation system, which addresses nearly every aspect of its sound, makes it the natural extension of Live‘s sound-shaping techniques. 28. 10. 1 Getting Started with Sampler Getting started with Sampler is as easy as choosing a preset from the browser. Like all of Live‘s devices, Sampler’s presets are located in folders listed beneath its name. Presets imported from third-party sample libraries are listed here, too, in the Imports folder. Once you have loaded a Sampler preset into a track, remember to arm the track for recording (which also enables you to hear any MIDI notes you might want to play), and then start playing! 28. 10.2 Multisampling Before going on, let’s introduce the concept of multisampling. This technique is used to accurately capture the complexity of instruments that produce dynamic timbral changes. Rather than rely on the simple transposition of a single recorded sample, multisampling captures an instrument at multiple points within its critical sonic range. This typically means capturing the instrument at different pitches as well as different levels of emphasis (played softly, moderately, loudly, etc.). The resulting multisample is a collection of all the individually recorded sample files. The acoustic piano, for example, is a commonly multisampled instrument. Because the piano’s pitch and dynamic ranges are very wide and timbrally complex, transposing one sample across many octaves would not reproduce the nuances of the instrument. Since multisampling relies on different sound sources, three or more samples per piano key could be made (soft, medium, loud, very loud, and so on), maximizing the sampler’s expressive possibilities. Sampler is designed to let you approach multisampling on whatever level you like: you can load and play multisample presets, import multisamples from third-party vendors, or create your own multisamples from scratch. Lastly, you do not have use multisamples at all — drop a single sample into Sampler and take advantage of its internal modulation system however you like.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "10 Sampler The Sampler Instrument."}]}

{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "10.6.1 Sample Playback.", "level": "main", "content": "All of the following parameters work in conjunction with the global volume envelope (in the Filter/ Global tab) to create the basic voicing of Sampler. These envelopes use standard ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) parameters, among others: Envelope Attack Time (Attack) — This sets the time it takes for an envelope to reach the peak level, starting from the initial level. The shape of the attack can be adjusted via the Attack Slope (A. Slope) parameter. Envelope Decay Time (Decay) — This sets the time it takes for an envelope to reach the sustain level from the peak level. The shape of the decay can be adjusted via the Decay Slope (D. Slope) parameter. Envelope Sustain Level (Sustain) — This is the sustain level at the end of the envelope decay. The envelope will stay at this level until note release unless it is in Loop, Sync or Beat Mode. Envelope Release Time (Release) — This is the time it takes for an envelope to reach the end level after a Note Off message is received. The shape of this stage of the envelope is determined by the Release Slope (R. Slope) value. Envelope Initial Level (Initial) — This sets the initial value of the envelope. Envelope Peak Level (Peak) — This is the peak level at the end of the envelope attack, and the beginning of the Decay stage. Envelope End Level (End) — (LFO, Filter and pitch envelopes only) This is the level reached at the end of the Release stage. Envelope Rates < Velocity (Time < Vel) — Envelope segments will be modulated by note velocity as defined by this setting. This is especially interesting if the envelopes are looping. Note that this modulation does not influence the beat-time in Beat or Sync Modes, but the envelope segments themselves. Envelope Loop Mode (Loop) — If this is set to Loop, the envelope will start again after the end of the decay segment. If set to Beat or Sync, it will start again after a given beat-time. In Sync Mode, this behavior will be quantized to song time. In Trigger mode, the envelope ignores Note Off. Envelope Beat/Sync Rate (Repeat) — The envelope will be retriggered after this amount of beat-time, as long as it is still on. When retriggered, the envelope will move at the given attack rate from the current level to the peak level. Envelope Loop Time (Time) — If a note is still on after the end of the decay/sustain segment, the envelope will start again from its initial value. The time it takes to move from the sustain level to the initial value is defined by this parameter. As mentioned above, Sampler’s envelopes also provide parameters that adjust the slope of their envelope segments. Positive slope values cause the envelope to move quickly at the beginning, then slower. Negative slope values cause the envelope to remain flat for longer, then move faster at the end. A slope of zero is linear; the envelope will move at the same rate throughout the segment. All time-based values in this tab are displayed in either samples or minutes:seconds:milliseconds, which can be toggled using the context menu on any of their parameter boxes. Samples, in this context, refer to the smallest measurable unit in digital audio, and not to the audio files themselves, which we more commonly refer to as “samples.“ Sample Start — The time value where playback will begin. If the volume envelope’s Attack parameter is set to a high value (slow attack), the audible result may begin some time later than the value shown here. Sample End — The time value where playback will end (unless a loop is enabled), even if the volume envelope has not ended. Sustain Mode — The optional Sustain Loop defines a region of the sample where playback will be repeated while the note is in the sustain stage of its envelope. Activating the Sustain Loop also allows the Release Loop to be enabled. This creates several playback options: No Sustain Loop — Playback proceeds linearly until either the Sample End is reached or the volume envelope completes its release stage. Sustain Loop Enabled — Playback proceeds linearly until Loop End is reached, when it jumps immediately to Loop Start and continues looping. If Release Mode is OFF, looping will continue inside the Sustain Loop until the volume envelope has completed its release stage. Back-and-Forth Sustain Loop Enabled — Playback proceeds to Loop End, then reverses until it reaches Loop Start, then proceeds again towards Loop End. If Release Mode is OFF, this pattern continues until the volume envelope has completed its release stage. Link — Enabling the Link switch sets Sample Start equal to Loop Start. Note that the Sample Start parameter box doesn’t lose its original value — it simply becomes disabled so that it can be recalled with a single click. Loop Start — The Sustain Loop’s start point, measured in samples. Loop End — The Sustain Loop’s end point, measured in samples. Release Mode — Whenever the Sustain Loop is active, Release Mode can also be enabled. — The volume envelope’s release stage is active, but will occur within the Sustain Loop, with playback never proceeding beyond Loop End. Release Enabled — When the volume envelope reaches its release stage, playback will proceed linearly towards Sample End. Release Loop Enabled — When the volume envelope reaches its release stage, playback will proceed linearly until reaching Sample End, where it jumps immediately to Release Loop and continues looping until the volume envelope has completed its release stage. Back-and-Forth Release Loop Enabled — When the volume envelope reaches its release stage, playback will proceed linearly until reaching Sample End, then reverses until it reaches Release Loop, then proceeds again towards Sample End. This pattern continues until the volume envelope has completed its release stage. Release Loop — sets the start position of the Release Loop. The end of the Release Loop is the Sample End. Sustain- and Release-Loop Crossfade (Crossfade) — Loop crossfades help remove clicks from loop transitions. By default, Sampler uses constant-power fades at loop boundaries. But by turning off “Use Constant Power Fade for Loops“ in the context menu, you can enable linear crossfades. Sustain- and Release-Loop Detune (Detune) — Since loops are nothing more than oscillations, the pitch of samples may shift within a loop, relative to the loop’s duration. Tip: this is especially noticeable with very short loops. With Detune, the pitch of these regions can be matched to the rest of the sample. Interpolation (Interpol) — This is a global setting that determines the accuracy of transposed samples. Be aware that raising the quality level above “Normal“ to “Good” or “Best” will place significant demands on your CPU. RAM Mode (RAM) — This is also a global control that loads the entire multisample into RAM. This mode can give better performance when modulating start and end points, but loading large multisamples into RAM will quickly leave your computer short of RAM for other tasks. In any case, it is always recommended to have as much RAM in your computer as possible, as this can provide significant performance gains. Hovering the mouse over the waveform and right-clicking to access the context menu provides a number of editing and viewing options. As with the context menu in the Sample Layer List, Show in Browser, Manage Samples, Normalize Volumes and Normalize Pan are available. Additionally, you can zoom in or out of playing or looping regions, depending on which Sustain and Loop Modes are selected. Finally, a few options remain on the far-right side of the Sample tab: Vertical Zoom (slider) — Magnifies the waveform height in the sample display.

FM — In this mode, the modulation oscillator will modulate the frequency of samples, resulting in more complex and different-sounding waveforms. AM — In this mode, the modulation oscillator will modulate the amplitude of samples. Subsonic modulator frequencies result in slow or rapid variation in the volume level; audible modulator frequencies result in composite waveforms. The modulation oscillator is controlled via Initial, Peak, Sustain, End, Loop, Attack and Time < Velocities parameters. For detailed information on how these work, see the Sample Playback section.

Volume — This determines the intensity of the modulation oscillator’s sample modulation. Vol < Vel — The modulation oscillator’s Volume parameter can be modified by the velocity of incoming MIDI notes. This determines the depth of the modulation. Fixed — When enabled, the modulation oscillator’s frequency will remain fixed at the rate determined by the Freq and Multi parameters, and will not change in response to incoming MIDI notes. Freq — With Fixed set to On, this rate is multiplied by the Multi parameter to determine the modulation oscillator’s fixed frequency. Multi — With Fixed set to On, the Freq parameter is multiplied by this amount to determine the modulation oscillator’s fixed frequency. Coarse — Coarse tuning of the modulation oscillator’s frequency (0. 1 25-48). This is only available when Fixed is set to Off. Fine — Fine tuning of the modulation oscillator’s frequency (0-1000).

The filter section offers a variety of filter types including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and a special Morph filter. Each filter can be switched between 1 2 and 24 dB slopes as well as a selection of analog-modeled circuit behaviors developed in conjunction with Cytomic that emulate hardware filters found on some classic analog synthesizers. The Clean circuit option is a high-quality, CPU-efficient design that is the same as the filters used in EQ Eight. This is available for all of the filter types. The OSR circuit option is a state-variable type with resonance limited by a unique hard-clipping diode. This is modeled on the filters used in a somewhat rare British monosynth, and is available for all filter types. The MS2 circuit option uses a Sallen-Key design and soft clipping to limit resonance. It is modeled on the filters used in a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters. The SMP circuit is a custom design not based on any particular hardware. It shares characteristics of both the MS2 and PRD circuits and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters. The PRD circuit uses a ladder design and has no explicit resonance limiting. It is modeled on the filters used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters. The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance. Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts frequencies near that point. When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the filter. The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass. You can quickly snap the Morph control to a low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, or notch setting via dedicated options in the context menu of the Morph slider. To the right, the filter’s cutoff frequency can be modulated over time by a dedicated filter envelope. This envelope works similarly to the envelopes in the Pitch/Osc tab, with Initial, Peak, Sustain and End levels, ADSR, Loop mode and slope points. This area is toggled on/off with the F. Env button. The Amount slider determines how much influence the filter envelope has on the filter’s cutoff frequency, and needs to be set to a non-zero value for the envelope to have any effect. Below the Filter is a waveshaper, which is toggled by clicking the Shaper button. Four different curves can be chosen for the waveshaper in the Type selector: Soft, Hard, Sine and 4bit. Shaper’s overall intensity can be controlled with the Amount slider.

For Loop and Trigger modes, if a note is still held when the Decay stage ends, the envelope will restart from its initial value. The time it takes to move from the Sustain level to the initial value is defined by the Time parameter. For Beat and Sync modes, if a note is still held after the amount set in the Repeat slider, the envelope will restart from its initial value.

Type — Sampler’s LFOs have 6 different waveshapes available: Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth Down, Sawtooth Up, and Sample and Hold. Rate — With Hz selected, the speed of the LFO is determined by the Freq slider to the right. With the note head selected, the LFO will be synced to beat-time, adjustable in the Beats slider to the right. Freq — The LFO’s rate in Hertz (cycles per second), adjustable from 0.01 to 30 Hz. Beats — This sets the LFO’s rate in beat-time (64th notes to 8 bars). LFO Attack (Attack) — This is the time needed for the LFO to reach maximum intensity. Use this, for example, to gradually introduce vibrato as a note is held. LFO Retrigger (Retrig) — Enabling Retrigger for an LFO will cause it to reset to its starting point, or initial phase, on each new MIDI note. This can create hybrid LFO shapes if the LFO is retriggered before completing a cycle. LFO Offset (Offset) — This changes the starting point, or initial phase of an LFO, so that it begins at a different point in its cycle. This can create hybrid LFO shapes if the LFO is retriggered before completing a cycle. LFO Rate < Key (Key) — Also known as keyboard tracking, non-zero values cause an LFO’s rate to increase relative to the pitch of incoming MIDI notes. LFO 1 has four sliders for quickly modulating global parameters: Volume (Vol) — LFO 1 can modulate the global volume level. This slider determines the depth of the modulation on a 0-100 scale. Pan (Pan) — LFO 1 can modulate the global pan position. This slider determines the depth of the modulation on a 0-100 scale. Filter — LFO 1 can modulate the filters cutoff frequency (Freq in the Filter/Global tab). This slider determines the depth of the modulation on a 0-24 scale. Pitch — LFO 1 can modulate the pitch of samples. This slider determines the depth of the modulation on a 0-100 scale. LFO Stereo Mode (Stereo) — LFOs 2 and 3 can produce two types of stereo modulation: Phase or Spin. In phase mode, the right and left LFO channels run at equal speed, and the Phase parameter is used to offset the right channel from the left.

A Simpler voice plays a user-defined region of a sample, which is in turn processed by envelope, filter, LFO, volume and pitch components. But unlike a conventional sampler, Simpler includes some unique functionality inherited from Live’s clips. Specifically, Simpler can play back samples using Live’s warping. Warped samples will play back at the tempo of your Set, regardless of which note you play. Warping in Simpler works in much the same way as it does in audio clips, and bringing a warped clip into Simpler from an audio track, the browser, or your desktop preserves your manual warp settings. For more information about warping, see the Audio Clips, Tempo, and Warping chapter. Simpler’s interface is divided into two sections: the Sample and Controls tabs. To get an even better view, you can toggle the location of the Sample controls between the device chain and Live’s main window by clicking the  button in Simpler’s title bar. When using this expanded view, the parameters in the Controls tab fill Simpler in the Device View. The Sample Tab displays the sample waveform. Samples can be dragged into Simpler either directly from the browser, or from the Session or Arrangement View in the form of clips. In the latter case, Simpler will use only the section of the sample demarcated by the clip’s start/end or loop markers. Any adjustments that have been made to a clip’s Warp Markers and other warping properties will be retained when dragging a clip into Simpler. Samples can be replaced by dragging in a new sample, or by activating the Hot-Swap button in the lower-right corner of the waveform display. Hot-Swapping a Sample.

Classic Playback Mode is the default mode when using Simpler, and is optimized for creating “conventional” melodic and harmonic instruments using pitched samples. It features a complete ADSR envelope and supports looping, allowing for samples to sustain as long as a note is held down. Classic Mode is polyphonic by default. One-Shot Playback Mode is exclusively for monophonic playback, and is optimized for use with one-shot drum hits or short sampled phrases. This mode has simplified envelope controls and does not support looping. By default, the entire sample will play back when a note is triggered, regardless of how long the note is held. Slicing Playback Mode non-destructively slices the sample so that the individual slices can be played back chromatically. You can create and move slices manually, or choose from a number of different options for how Simpler will automatically create slices.

{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "11.1.1 Classic Playback Mode The Sample Tab in Classic Playback Mode.", "level": "main", "content": "In Classic Playback Mode, the various sample position controls change which region of the sample you play back. These controls include the Start and Length parameters as well as the two “flags” that appear in the waveform display. The left flag sets the absolute position in the sample from which playback can start, while the End control sets where playback can end. Start and Length are then represented in percentages of the total sample length enabled by the flags. For example, a Length value of 50% will play exactly half of the region between the flags. The Loop slider determines how much of the available sample will loop. This parameter is only active if the Loop switch is enabled. It’s possible to create sustaining loops that are so short they take on a glitchy or granular character, or even take on a pitch as a result of looping at audio rates. While this might be exactly the effect you want, it can cause very high CPU loads, particularly when working with the Complex or Complex Pro Warp Modes. Quite often, you’ll start with a longer region of a sample and end up using only a small part of it. Simpler’s waveform display can be zoomed and panned just as in other parts of Live — drag vertically or scroll with the mousewheel or trackpad while holding the Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) modifier to zoom, and drag horizontally to pan different areas of the sample into view. Zooming works the same in all three playback modes. Pressing the Loop On/Off button determines whether or not the sample will loop when a note is held down. It is possible for glitches or pops to occur between a looped sample’s start and end points due to the discontinuity in waveform amplitude (i.e., the sample’s loudness). The Snap switch will help mitigate these by forcing Simpler’s loop and region markers to snap to zero-crossing points in the sample (points where the amplitude is zero). Snapping is based on the left channel of stereo samples. It is therefore still possible, even with Snap activated, to encounter glitches with stereo samples. The transition from loop end to loop start can be smoothed with the Fade control, which crossfades the two points. This method is especially useful when working with long, textural samples. The Gain slider allows you to boost or cut the level of the sample. Note that this is a separate gain stage from Simpler’s Volume knob, which determines the final output level of the entire instrument (after processing through Simpler’s filter). This parameter is available in all three playback modes. The Voices parameter sets the maximum number of voices that Simpler can play simultaneously. If more voices are needed than have been allocated by the Voices chooser, “voice stealing“ will take place, in which the oldest voice(s) will be dropped in favor of those that are new. For example, if your Voices parameter is set to 8, and ten voices are all vying to be played, the two oldest voices will be dropped. (Simpler does try to make voice stealing as subtle as possible.) With Retrig enabled, a note that is already sustaining will be cut off if the same note is played again. If Retrig is disabled, multiple copies of the same note can overlap.

The Slice By chooser determines the specific way in which slices will be created: Transient - Slices are placed on the sample’s transients automatically. The Sensitivity slider determines how sensitive Simpler is to transient levels within the sample, and thus how many slices will be automatically created. Higher numbers result in more slices, up to a maximum of 64 slices. Beat - Slices are placed at musical beat divisions. The Division chooser selects the beat division at which Simpler will slice the sample region. Region - Slices are placed at equal time divisions. The Regions chooser selects the number of evenly-spaced slices that will be created. Manual - Slices are created manually, by double-clicking within the sample region. When Manual is selected, no slices are placed automatically. The Playback chooser determines how many slices can be triggered simultaneously. Mono is monophonic; only one slice can be played at a time. When set to Poly, multiple slices can be triggered together. The Voices and Retrig controls are available with Poly enabled, and work as they do in Classic Playback Mode. When set to Thru, playback is monophonic, but triggering one slice will continue playback through the rest of the sample region. The Trigger/Gate switch works the same as it does in One-Shot Playback Mode. The Fade In and Out controls behave slightly differently, depending on the setting of the Playback chooser. With Mono or Poly selected, the Fade times are measured from the beginning to the end of each individual slice, while with Thru selected, they are measured from the triggered slice to the end of the region. This means that the fade times may sound different depending on where in the region you trigger. Automatically created slices appear as vertical blue lines on the waveform display. Double-clicking a slice deletes it. If you’re not satisfied with Simpler’s automatic slice placement, you can click and drag a slice to move it to a new position.

Each filter can be switched between 1 2 and 24 dB slopes as well as a selection of analog-modeled circuit behaviors developed in conjunction with Cytomic that emulate hardware filters found on some classic analog synthesizers. The Clean circuit option is a high-quality, CPU-efficient design that is the same as the filters used in EQ Eight. This is available for all of the filter types. The OSR circuit option is a state-variable type with resonance limited by a unique hard-clipping diode. This is modeled on the filters used in a somewhat rare British monosynth, and is available for all filter types. The MS2 circuit option uses a Sallen-Key design and soft clipping to limit resonance. It is modeled on the filters used in a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters. The SMP circuit is a custom design not based on any particular hardware. It shares characteristics of both the MS2 and PRD circuits and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters. The PRD circuit uses a ladder design and has no explicit resonance limiting. It is modeled on the filters used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters. The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance. Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts frequencies near that point. When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the filter. The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass. You can quickly snap the Morph control to a low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, or notch setting via dedicated options in the context menu of the Morph knob. The Frequency and Envelope buttons in the filter section’s display area toggle between showing the filter’s frequency response and its envelope. Filter cutoff frequency and resonance can be adjusted via the knobs or by dragging the filter response curve in the display area.

Simpler also offers a special Spread parameter that creates a rich stereo chorus by using two voices per note and panning one to the left and one to the right. The two voices are detuned, and the amount of detuning can be adjusted with the Spread control. Whether or not spread is applied to a particular note depends upon the setting of the Spread parameter during the Note On event. To achieve special effects, you could, for instance, create a sequence where Spread is zero most of the time and turned on only for some notes. These notes will then play in stereo, while the others will play mono. The output volume of Simpler is controlled by the Volume control, which can also be dependent upon note velocity, as adjusted by the Velocity > Volume control. Tremolo effects can be achieved by allowing the LFO to modulate the Volume parameter. Simpler plays back a sample at its original pitch if the incoming MIDI note is C3, however the Transpose control allows transposing this by +/- 48 semitones. Pitch can also be modulated by the LFO or pitch envelope. The pitch envelope is especially helpful in creating percussive sounds. Simpler reacts to MIDI Pitch Bend messages with a sensitivity of +/- 5 semitones. You can also modulate the Transpose parameter with clip envelopes and external controllers. For fine tuning of the pitch, use the Detune control, which can be adjusted +/- 50 cents. Simpler includes a glide function. When this function is activated, new notes will start from the pitch of the last note played and then slide gradually to their own pitch.

This elaborate synthesis engine responds dynamically to the control signals it receives while you play thereby reproducing the richness and responsiveness of real string instruments. Tension features four types of exciters (two types of hammer, a pick and a bow), an accurate model of a string, a model of the fret/finger interaction, a damper model and different types of soundboards. The combination of these different elements allows for the reproduction of a wide range of string instruments.

A damper can be applied to the strings in order to reduce the decay time of the oscillation. This is the case on a piano, for example, when felt is applied to the strings by releasing the keys and sustain pedal. The vibration from the string is then transmitted to the body of the instrument, which can radiate sound efficiently. In some instruments, the string vibration is transmitted directly to the body through the bridge. In other instruments, such as the electric guitar, a pickup is used to transmit the string vibration to an amplifier. In addition to these main sections, a filter section has been included between the string and body sections in order to expand the sonic possibilities of the instrument. The Tension interface is divided into two main tabs, which are further divided into sections.

The bow sets the string in sustained oscillation. The motion of the bow hair across the string creates friction, causing the string to alternate between sticking to the hair and breaking free. The frequency of this alternation between sticking and slipping determines the fundamental pitch. Note that the Damping knob is unavailable when the Bow exciter is selected. Hammer — this exciter type simulates the behavior of soft hammers or mallets. Hammer models a hammer that is located below the string and strikes it once before falling away. This type of mechanism is found in a piano, for example.

{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "12.2.4 The Damper Section Tension’s Damper Section. All string instruments employ some type of damping mechanism that mutes the resonating string. In pianos, this is a felt pad that is applied to the string when the key is released. In instruments such as guitars and violins, the player damps by stopping the string’s vibration with their fingers. Dampers regulate the decay of strings but also produce some sound of their own, which is an important characteristic of a string instrument’s timbre. The Damper section can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name. Although a damper functions to mute the string rather than activate it, it is somewhat analogous to a hammer, and shares some of the same parameters. The Mass knob controls how hard the damper’s surface will press against the string. As you increase the value, the string will mute more quickly. The stiffness of the damper’s material is adjusted with the Stiffness control. Lower values simulate soft materials such as felt, while higher values model a metal damper. Note that very high Mass and Stiffness values can simulate dampers that connect with the string hard enough to change its effective length, thus causing a change in tuning. The Velocity control adjusts the speed with which the damper is applied to the string when the key is released, as well as the speed with which it is lifted from the string when the key is depressed. Be careful with this parameter — very high Velocity values can cause the damper to hit the string extremely hard, which can result in a very loud sound on key release. Note that the state of the Gated switch determines whether or not the Velocity control is enabled. When the Gated switch is turned on,", "level": "main", "content": "the damper is applied to the string when the key is released. With Gated off, the damper always remains on the string, which means that the Velocity control has no effect. The Position knob serves an analogous function to the control in the Exciter section, but here specifies the point on the string where the damper makes contact. At 0%, the damper contacts the string at its termination point, while at 50% it damps the string at its midpoint. The behavior is a bit different if the Fix. Pos switch is enabled, however. In this case, the contact point is fixed to a single location, rather than changing as the length of the string changes. The Mass, Stiffness and Velocity, and Position parameters can be further modulated by note pitch using the Key sliders below them. The stiffness of the damper mechanism is adjusted with the Damping knob, which affects the overall amount of vibration absorbed by the damper. Lower values result in less damping (longer decay times). But this becomes a bit less predictable as the Damping value goes over 50%. At higher values, the mechanism becomes so stiff that it bounces against the string. This in turn reduces the overall amount of time that the damper is in contact with the string, causing an increase in decay time. The best way to get a sense of how this parameter behaves is to gradually turn up the knob as you repeatedly strike a single key. The String Section Tension’s String Section. The vibration of the string is the main component of a stringed instrument’s sound. The effective length of the string is also responsible for the pitch of the sound we hear. The Decay slider determines how long it takes for the resonating string to decay to silence. Higher values increase the decay time. The < Key slider next to Decay allows decay time to be modulated by note pitch. The Ratio slider sets the ratio of the decay time of the string’s oscillation during note onset and release. At 0%, the time set by the Decay slider sets the decay time for both the onset and release of the note. As you increase the Ratio, the release time decreases but the onset decay time stays the same. The theoretical model of a resonating string is harmonic, meaning that the string’s partials are all exact multiples of the fundamental frequency. Real-world strings, however, are all more or less inharmonic, and this increases with the width of the string. The Inharm slider models this behavior, causing upper partials to become increasingly out of tune as its value increases. The Damping slider adjusts the amount of high frequency content in the string’s vibration. Higher values result in more upper partials (less damping). This parameter can be modulated by note pitch via the < Key slider to its right. The Vibrato Section Tension’s Vibrato Section. The Vibrato section uses an LFO to modulate the string’s pitch. As with all of Tension’s parameters, the controls in this section can be used to enhance the realism of a stringed instrument model — or to create something never heard before. The Vibrato section can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name. The Delay slider sets how long it will take for the vibrato to start after the note begins, while Attack sets how long it takes for the vibrato to reach full intensity (as set by the Amount knob). The two most important parameters in this section are the Rate and Amount sliders. Rate adjusts the frequency of the pitch variation, while Amount adjusts the intensity (amplitude) of the effect. The < Mod slider adjusts how much the modulation wheel will affect the vibrato intensity. This control is relative to the value set by the Amount knob.

At 0%, the pickup is located at the string’s termination point, while at 50% it is under the midpoint of the string. Lower values generally result in a brighter, thinner sound, while higher values have more fullness and depth. The Body Section Tension’s Body Section. The role of the body or soundboard of a string instrument is to radiate the vibration energy from the strings. The body also filters these vibrations, based on its size and shape. In some instruments, such as guitars, the body also includes an air cavity which boosts low frequencies. The Body section can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name. The Body Type chooser allows you to select from different body types modeled after physical instruments. The Body Size chooser sets the relative size of the resonant body, from extra small (XS) to extra large (XL). In general, as you increase the body size, the frequency of the resonance will become lower. The decay time of the body’s resonance can be adjusted with the Decay knob. Higher values mean a longer decay. The Str/Body knob adjusts the ratio between the String section’s direct output and the signal filtered by the Body section. When turned all the way to the right, there is no direct output from the String section. When turned all the way to the left, the Body section is effectively bypassed. You can further modify the body’s frequency response with the Low Cut and High Cut knobs. Tension’s Volume Knob.

This knob is also accessible from the Filter/Global tab.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "12.2.6 The Pickup Section Tension’s Pickup Section."}]}
{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "12.3 Filter/Global Tab Tension’s Filter/Global Tab.", "level": "main", "content": "Tension’s Filter/Global tab features a polyphonic filter with envelope, LFO, and MIDI modulation options, keyboard and portamento options, and an integrated Unison audio effect. Tension’s Filter Section. Tension’s Filter section features a highly configurable multi-mode filter that sits between the String and Body sections. In addition, the filter can be modulated by a dedicated envelope generator and low-frequency oscillator (LFO). Note that the entire Filter section can be toggled on or off via the switch in the Filter subsection, while the Filter Envelope and Filter LFO sections each have their own individual toggles. The filter’s chooser allows you to select the filter type. You can choose between 2nd and 4th order low-pass, band-pass, notch, high-pass and formant filters. The resonance frequency of the filter is adjusted with the Freq slider, while the amount of resonance is adjusted with the Res control. When a formant filter is selected, the Res control cycles between vowel sounds. The Freq and Res controls can each be modulated by LFO, envelope or note pitch via the sliders below. Note that the LFO and Env sliders have no effect unless the Envelope and LFO subsections are enabled. The Filter Envelope subsection can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name. It is a standard ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) with a few twists: While the attack time is set with the Attack knob, this time can also be modulated by MIDI note velocity via the Vel slider below the knob. As you increase the Vel value, the attack time will become increasingly shorter at higher velocities. The time it takes for the envelope to reach the sustain level after the attack phase is set by the Decay knob. The Sustain knob sets the level at which the envelope remains at the end of the decay phase until the key is released. When this knob is turned all the way to the left, there is no sustain phase. With it turned all the way to the right, there is no decay phase. The sustain level can be additionally modulated by note velocity via the Vel slider below the knob. Higher values result in an increased sustain level as the velocity increases. The release time is set with the Release knob. This is the time it takes for the envelope to reach zero after the key is released. The Filter LFO subsection provides an additional modulation source for the filter. This section can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name. The LFO waveform chooser sets the type of waveform used by the LFO. You can choose between sine, triangle, rectangular and two types of random waveforms. The first random waveform steps between random values while the second uses smoother ramps. The LFO’s speed is set with the Rate knob. The switches below this knob toggle the Rate between frequency in Hertz and tempo-synced beat divisions. Lastly, the Attack knob controls how long it takes for the oscillator to reach its full amplitude while the Delay knob controls how long it will take for the LFO to start after the note begins. Tension’s MPE Section. The MPE section includes mapping options for MPE pressure and slide data, as well as the option to set Tension’s global and per-note pitch bend ranges. All three MPE sources include Activity LEDs, which light up whenever Tension receives MPE signals. For both the Pressure and Slide sources, you can choose two destinations where MPE data is routed, and adjust the level of modulation using the Amount sliders. Pitch Bend controls allow you to adjust the modulation range for global pitch bend, as well as the MPE per-note pitch bend (Note PB) in semitones. Tension’s Keyboard Section. The Keyboard section contains all of Tension’s polyphony, tuning, MIDI parameters. The Octave, Semi and Detune controls function as coarse and fine tuners. Octave transposes the entire instrument by octaves, while Semi transposes up or down in semitone increments. The Detune slider adjusts in increments of one cent (up to a maximum of 50 cents up or down). The Voices chooser sets the available polyphony. Stretch simulates a technique known as stretch tuning, which is a common tuning modification made to electric and acoustic pianos. At 0%, Tension will play in equal temperament, which means that two notes are an octave apart when the upper note’s fundamental pitch is exactly twice the lower note’s. But because the actual resonance behavior of a vibrating tine or string differs from the theoretical model, equal temperament tends to sound “wrong“ on pianos. Increasing the Stretch amount raises the pitch of upper notes while lowering the pitch of lower ones. The result is a more brilliant sound. Negative values simulate “negative“ stretch tuning; upper notes become flatter while lower notes become sharper. The Error slider increases the amount of random tuning error applied to each note. Try very high values if you would like to relive your experiences from junior high school orchestra. Lastly, Priority determines which notes will be cut off when the maximum polyphony is exceeded. When Priority is set to High, new notes that are higher than currently sustained notes will have priority, and notes will be cut off starting from the lowest pitch. Low Priority is the opposite. The Last setting gives priority to the most recently played notes, cutting off the oldest notes as necessary. Tension’s Portamento Section. The Portamento section is used to make the pitch slide between notes rather than changing immediately. The effect can be toggled on and off via the switch next to its name. The Time slider sets the overall speed of the slide. With Legato enabled, the sliding will only occur if the second note is played before the first note is released. Prop. (Proportional) causes the slide time to be proportional to the interval between the notes. Large intervals will slide slower than small intervals. Disabling this switch causes the slide time to be constant regardless of interval. Tension’s Unison Section. The Unison section allows you to stack multiple voices for each note played. Use the Unison toggle to switch the section on or off. The Voices switch selects between two or four stacked voices, while Detune adjusts the amount of tuning variation applied to each stacked voice. Low values can create a subtle chorusing effect, while high values provide another good way to approximate a youth orchestra. Increasing the Delay amount adds lag before each stacked voice is activated. Tension’s Volume Knob. The Volume knob in the corner sets the overall output of the instrument. This knob is also accessible from the String tab.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "12.3 Filter/Global Tab Tension’s Filter/Global Tab."}]}

But it’s important to remember that Tension’s components are not isolated from one another; what you do to one parameter can have a dramatic effect on a parameter somewhere else. Because of this, it’s very easy to find parameter combinations that produce no sound at all. It’s also very easy to create extremely loud sounds, so be careful when setting levels! When using Tension, it may help to think about the various sections as if they really are attached to a single, physical object. For example, a bow moving at a slow speed could perhaps excite an undamped string. But if that string is constricted by an enormous damper, the bow will need to increase its velocity to have any effect. To get a sense of what’s possible, it may help to study how the presets were made. You’ll soon realize that Tension can do far more than just strings.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "12.4 Sound Design Tips"}]}

As long as no modulation is applied, the raw output of the oscillators is perfectly band-limited and will not produce aliasing artifacts at any pitch. Wavetable’s Oscillators. Each oscillator can be turned on or off independently via a switch in the oscillator’s tab. Clicking a tab will select that oscillator, revealing its parameters for editing. The overall output level of each oscillator is adjusted with its Gain slider, while its position in the stereo field can be adjusted with the Pan control. The coarse and fine tuning of each oscillator can be set with the Semi and Detune controls. Note that this tuning is in relation to the global Transposition slider. Select a wavetable using the choosers or the arrow buttons. The first chooser selects a category of wavetable, while the second chooser selects a specific wavetable from within that category. The arrow buttons will automatically switch to the next category when you reach the end of the current one, so you can continuously move through the wavetables using the arrows alone. You can extend the sonic capabilities of Wavetable’s oscillator section by loading any WAV or AIFF file as a wavetable. To do this, drag and drop a sample from the browser directly onto the wavetable visualization. The choosers and arrow buttons will now reference the folder containing the imported sample, allowing you to quickly audition any other samples in that folder. Wavetable will automatically process imported samples to reduce unwanted artefacts. Note that you can bypass this processing by activating the Raw mode switch. Raw mode is especially useful when loading files that have been prepared specifically for use as a wavetable. However, it can also be “misused” to create unpredictable, noisy or glitchy sounds. Wavetable’s Raw Mode Switch. The oscillator’s wavetable is visualized in the center of the oscillator tab. Clicking and dragging within the visualization will move to a different position within the wavetable. You can also change the wavetable position via the Wave Position slider. There are two types of wavetable visualizations available, and these can be switched via the wavetable visualization switch. Both views represent the same information, but visualized in different ways. The linear view arranges the waveforms from bottom to top, with time running from left to right. The polar view displays the waveforms as loops from inside to outside, with time running clockwise. Although there is a huge range of available wavetables, it’s also possible to transform the sound of each wavetable itself through the use of oscillator effects. Select from three effects in the chooser and then adjust the parameters for those effects via the sliders to the right. The oscillator effects include: FM — Applies frequency modulation to the oscillator. The Amt slider adjusts the intensity of the frequency modulation, while the Tune slider determines the frequency of the modulation oscillator. With a tuning of 50% (and -50%), the modulation oscillator is one octave higher (or lower) than the main oscillator. At 100% (and -100%), the modulation oscillator is two octaves higher (or lower). In between these values, the modulation oscillator is at inharmonic ratios, which is ideal for creating noisy overtones. Classic — Provides two modulation types that are common from classic analog synthesizers. PW adjusts the pulse width of the waveform. Note that in hardware synthesizers, it is normally only possible to adjust the pulse width of square waves. In Wavetable, the pulse width can be adjusted for all wavetables. Sync applies a “hidden” oscillator that resets the phase of the audible oscillator, altering its timbre. Modern — Provides two additional options for distorting the shape of the waveform. Warp is similar to pulse width, while Fold applies wavefolding distortion. Note that the values of the two effects parameters don’t change when the effect type changes. This makes it possible to move between the effects to experiment with how the different processes affect the timbre with the same values.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "13.2 Oscillators"}]}

{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "13.4 Filters", "level": "main", "content": "Wavetable’s filters can be very useful for shaping the sonically rich timbres created by the oscillators and their effects. And, since the oscillators also provide you with the classic waveforms of analog synthesizers, you can very easily build a subtractive-style synthesizer with them. Wavetable’s Filters. Wavetable offers a variety of filter types including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and a special Morph filter. Each filter can be switched between 1 2 and 24 dB slopes as well as a selection of analog-modeled circuit behaviors developed in conjunction with Cytomic that emulate hardware filters found on some classic analog synthesizers. The Clean circuit option is a high-quality, CPU-efficient design that is the same as the filters used in EQ Eight. This is available for all of the filter types. The OSR circuit option is a state-variable type with resonance limited by a unique hard-clipping diode. This is modeled on the filters used in a somewhat rare British monosynth, and is available for all filter types. The MS2 circuit option uses a Sallen-Key design and soft clipping to limit resonance. It is modeled on the filters used in a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters. The SMP circuit is a custom design not based on any particular hardware. It shares characteristics of both the MS2 and PRD circuits and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters. The PRD circuit uses a ladder design and has no explicit resonance limiting. It is modeled on the filters used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters. The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance. Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts frequencies near that point. Note that you can adjust the Frequency and Resonance parameters by clicking and dragging either of the filter dots in the filter display. When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the filter. The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass. Filter routing allows you to arrange the filters in various configurations for drastically different sculpting techniques. You can choose from one of three different routings: Serial — Routes all oscillators into Filter 1, and routes Filter 1 into Filter 2. Sub is routed to both filters. Parallel — Routes the two main oscillators into Filter 1 and Filter 2. Sub is routed to both filters. Split — Routes Oscillator 1 to Filter 1, and Oscillator 2 to Filter 2. Sub is split in half and sent to both filters. If either filter is off, the corresponding oscillator’s signal is still audible. Split can be used to treat each filter separately, and is useful for cases where you want to create layered synth sounds. If the main oscillators are disabled while both filters are engaged, Split can also be used to add extra treatment to the Sub oscillator.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "28", "title": "13.4 Filters"}]}

The area where you work with Max objects is called the editor (or “patcher“), and can be accessed by pressing the Edit button in the Max device’s title bar. The Edit Button for a Max Device. This launches the Max editor in a new window, with the current device loaded and ready for editing. A Default Max Audio Effect in the Patcher. After editing, you should save your Max device before you use it in Live. This is done via the Save or Save As commands in Max’s File menu. Saving an edited device will automatically update all instances of that device that are used in your current Live Set. If you choose Save As, you will be asked whether or not the new version should update only the device that was originally opened for editing or all instances of the device in the Set. The default location when saving a Max device is the folder in the Library that corresponds to the type of device being saved. We recommend always saving Max devices to this default location. Unlike Live’s native devices, Max devices are not saved inside Live Sets, but rather as separate files.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "29", "title": "3 Editing Max for Live Devices"}]}

By editing an existing Max for Live MIDI Tool. Building a Max for Live MIDI Tool follows the same principles as building other Max for Live devices: with a Max MIDI Transformation/Generator template or an existing Max for Live MIDI Tool selected, click on the Edit button to launch the Max editor (“patcher”). The Edit Button in a Max MIDI Transformation. When you are done editing, use the Save or Save As commands in the patcher’s File menu to save the Max for Live MIDI Tool. By default, Max for Live MIDI Tools are saved to these folders on your computer: Transformations: ~/Music/Ableton/User Library/MIDI Tools/Max Transformations Generators: ~/Music/Ableton/User Library/MIDI Tools/Max Generators Alternatively, any folder within Places in Live’s browser can be used to store the MIDI Tools’ AMXD files. For example, you could create a new folder called “My Favorite MIDI Tools” and save the Max for Live MIDI Tools you have built within this folder. Then when you add the folder to Places in Live, these MIDI Tools will appear in the drop-down menus in the Transformation/Generative Tools tabs/ panels. Note that if Max for Live MIDI Tools are not saved to the default location or within Live’s Places, they will not be found by Live’s Indexer, and therefore will not appear in the Clip View’s Transformation/ Generative Tools tabs/panels. For more information on the Max objects used for creating Max for Live MIDI Tools, as well as a walkthrough of patching a Max for Live Transformation or Generator, please refer to the Max for Live MIDI Tools guide, accessible via the Max documentation.

{"chunk_id": "29", "title": "5 Max Dependencies", "level": "main", "content": "As mentioned earlier, there are some special file management considerations when creating presets for Max devices. Additionally, Max devices themselves may depend on other files (such as samples, pictures, or even other Max patches) in order to work properly. Max for Live helps to deal with external dependencies by allowing you to freeze a Max device. A frozen device contains all of the files that are needed to use it. Note that freezing of Max devices is not the same as Live’s Freeze Track command. To learn more about freezing, and about how Max deals with managing dependencies for its own files, we recommend reading the built-in Max documentation.", "parent_chain": [{"chunk_id": "29", "title": "5 Max Dependencies"}]}
